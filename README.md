# Purpose in life

This component provides everything needed to generate random tokens for users that can be later
exchanged for user information.

# Usage
## Generate token

REST API endpoint `/mws/v1/user-token/generate` can be used to generate a token for the user.

Client-side: `mws.tokenAuthenticator.generateToken( withIssuer )`.
Params: `withIssuer` - boolean - default: false. If `true`, will include info about the wiki (url) that
issued the token. To be used when verifying token, as a target for verification.
If used, [salt](#salt) must be used.

## Verify token

Call REST API endpoint `/mws/v1/user-token/verify/{token}` to verify the token. If valid, you will receive 
info on the user that the token was issued for, including user ID, username, and other info.

### Verification when using salt
If token was salted, you will need to decode it using the salt, and then b64 decode it.
Pass only the `token` from the decoded token object at verification time.

## Salt

Configure `$GLOBALS['mwsgTokenAuthenticatorSalt'] = '<random string>';` in your `LocalSettings.php` file,
to salt the tokens issued by this service. This is recommended for security reasons.
Note that token will only be salted if so required, not by default.

When salted, token structure is changed, instead of just a plain string token, token is
a b64-encoded JSON that looks like this

    [
        'verifyCallback' => $callbackUrl,
        'token' => $token,
        'sig' => $signature,
    ]

Where:
- `verifyCallback` is the URL to call to verify the token, wiki that generated it.
- `token` is the actual token
- `sig` is the signature of the token to verify its issuer is trustworthy.
Signature is a HMAC value generated by hasing `verifyCallback . token` with the salt.
